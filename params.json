{"name":"Trumpscript","tagline":"Make Python great again","body":"# TrumpScript\r\nMaking Python great again\r\n\r\n## Mission\r\nTrumpScript is language based upon the illustrious Donald Trump. As the undeniably best presidential candidate in the 2016 language, we found that the current field of programming languages does not include any that Trump's glorious golden combover would approve of.\r\n\r\nTrumpScript is our solution to this. It's the programming language Trump would approve of. Just like he is making America great again, we hope our efforts will make programming great again.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nOur language includes several convenient features, perfect for any aspiring Presidential candidate including:\r\n* No floating point numbers, only integers. America never does anything halfway.\r\n* All numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million. The small stuff is inconsequential to us.\r\n* There are no import statements allowed. All code has to be home-grown and Amerian made.\r\n* Instead of \"True\" and \"False,\" we have \"fact\" and \"lie\"\r\n* Only the most popular English words, Trump's favorite words, and current politician names can be used as variable names.\r\n* Error messages are mostly quotes directly taken from Trump himself.\r\n* All programs must end with \"America is great.\"\r\n* Our language will automatically correct Forbes' $4.5B to $10B\r\n* In it's raw form, TrumpScript is not compatible with Windows, because Trump isn't the type of guy to believe in PC\r\n* The language is completely case insensitive\r\n\r\n## Grammar\r\nThe grammar of the language is fairly convoluted, but here's a taste of the enlightened decisions we've made.\r\n\r\nArithmetic operators:\r\n* '+' and 'plus' do addition\r\n* '-' and 'minus' do subtraction\r\n* '*' and 'times' do multiplication\r\n* '/' and 'over' do division\r\n* '<', 'less', 'fewer', and 'smaller' all evaluate to 'less than'\r\n* '>', 'more', 'greater', and 'larger' all evaluate to 'greater than'\r\n\r\nControl flow:\r\n* Use ',' and ';' to treat compound statements as a single evaluation, similar to how '()' are used in other languages\r\n* Use ':' and '!' to define the scope of loops and if statements, similar to how '{}' is used in Java\r\n* 'if', 'else if', and 'else' do what you think they do\r\n* 'not', 'and', and 'or' do what you expect\r\n\r\nThe exciting parts:\r\n* Strings are denoted by double quotes (\"I love Trump\")\r\n* The 'is' and 'are' keywords are used both to check for equality, and for assignment. To use for assignment, say something like 'Trump is great' or 'Democrats are dumb'. To use to check for equality, do the same but append a '?'. For example, you may need to ask yourself 'Trump is \"the best\"?' (although we all know that would evaluate to 'fact' anyway)\r\n* Assignment can also be done via the 'make' keyword. E.g. 'Make America great' assigns the value of the variable 'great' to 'America'\r\n* Printing to stdout can be done via 'tell' or 'say'\r\n* While loops are denoted via 'as long as'. And that's the only type of loop you need anyway.\r\n\r\n## History\r\nCreated for HackRice (hack.rice.edu) by:\r\n\r\nSam Shadwell, @samshadwell\r\n\r\nDan Korn, @DnlRKorn\r\n\r\nChris Brown, @CryoBrown\r\n\r\nCannon Lewis, @cannon10100\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
